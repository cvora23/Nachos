****************************************** Assignment 1 - Part 2 Documentation ******************************************

Simulating Super Market.
Each Market Component is to be simulated using different Threads.

1: Cashiers - Scans Customer purchase.
2: Customers - Buy and return items from the store.
3: Good Loaders - Load Items in department when they are out of stocks.
4: Managers - Tell the department salesman to start/stop working and look at total sales.
5: Department Salesman - Guide and interact with customers before and after their purchase from a Particular Department.

1: Cashiers: 
Scans items that a Customer has to buy. 
Pass 1 item at a time to the counter and scan them.
When all items are scanned Cashier then tells Customer the total cost.
Cashier gets money from Customer then tells Customer they can leave.
If Customer do not have enough money to pay for all the items Cashier tells to Manager.
Cashier do not leave the counter until he/she is asked by the Manager.
They get to take the leave (ASSUMPTION: after asking Manager) until Manager tells them to get back to work.
Whenever cashier is sent on a break he/she informs Customer in line to disperse to another line before leaving the counter.
Cashier 1 - 5.

Interactions of Cashier: 
Cashier --------------------------- Customers
Cashier --------------------------- Managers

2: Customer:
Priveleged or not.
Randomly select privelged customers for your simulation.
When Customer enters super market they need to get in line for trolley.
After securing the torlly, they can shop in any Department (1 to 5).
To shop in Department they need to interact with Department Salesman (there can be 3 for each Department)'
If Department salesman are busy Customer get in line. 
One line for each department, regardless of salesman for each department.
Customer select items for that purchase.
After they are done they move to Cashier.
They are to have atleast 1 to 10 items to buy.
You can randomly generate number and type of items.
Once they have their items, they look for a Cashier.
Priveleged customers are given priority over other Customers. 
Because no one wants to stand in line longer than necessary, they must find Cashier with shortest line.
If multiple short lines pick one at random.
Cashier tells them their bill.
If Customers doesn't have enough Money CAshier informs the Manager who interacts with Customer about which goods to be removed.
Customer pays their money to Cashier and wait for receipt, then they leave.
Number of Customers vary tremendously, there is no fixed number you are to have.
You can decide for your various tests.
If the Customer has to interact with the Manager, then they pay to Manager directly.
Customer may notice some items out of stock.
This happens whenever number of items on a shelf is 0.
When a Customer takes item from shelf, number of items for that shelf is decremented by appropriate amount.
You can assume that ther is only one type of item on each shelf.
When a Customer cannot find an item in stock, the must inform Department salesman who will ask Good Loader to load the required goods.
Customer must wait for items to be restocked.
Once the goods are loaded Good Loader will inform the Department Salesman about it and the Salesman will notify Customer of the loaded goods.

Interaction of Customer:
Customer ----------------------------------- Department Salesman
Customer ----------------------------------- Manager
Customer ----------------------------------- Cashier.

3: Good Loader:
Restock shelves that have had items purchased.
Good Loaders are woken up by Department Salesman when there are items to be restocked.
To restock an item, the retrieve on new item from stock room at a time (stock room has infinite supply of all items sold by store)
They will then go to proper aisle and put it on store shelves.
The stock room is filled with items, so there is room for only one Goods Loader to be retrieving items at a time.
Once a Goods Loader has placed an item on the shelf, they check to see if any more items need to be restocked.
If so they go back for another item.
It takes time for Goods Loader to walk from stock room to appropriate shelf. You are to simulate this by having a variable number of currentThread->Yield() statements executed.
Just use a for loop with a random number for the looping variable. 
Your loop variable should be from 20 to 40 iterations in value.

Interaction of Goods Loader:
Goods Loader ------------------------------------- Department Salesman

4: Department Salesman:
Interact with Customers who wish to stop in the particular department.
Informed by customers if items are out stock.
Will notify goods loader to restock the item.
After item is restocked Goods Loader informs the Salesman about aisle number of item being restocked.
Department salesman do not wait for items to be restocked.
They can interact with other customers while items are being restocked.

Interactions of Department Salesman:
Department Salesman ---------------------------------- Customer
Department Salesman ---------------------------------- Goods Loader


5: Manager:
Keep track of total sales for the Super Market.
Sends Cashier on break.
Interact with customer in case the Customer cant afford the total amount.
Manager never goes on break.
He keeps checking to see if there is something to do.
Every so often Manager displays total sales of entier store up to that point.
Whenever Manager gets call from Cashier for cancellation of item, Manager interacts customer to cancel items until customer can afford the total amount.
Manager will regularly empty counter drawers to keep track of total sales.

Interaction of Manager:
Manager ------------------------------------- Customer
Manager ------------------------------------- Cashier



Number of threads of each type
Manager - Only 1
Cashiers - 1 to 5
Department - 1 to 5
Department Salesman - 1 to 3 per Department
Good Loaders - 1 to 5
Customers - Atleast 30, but simulation should run with any number of Customers.
