ASSUMPTIONS: NACHOS WILL GIVE SAME PREDICTABLE OUTPUT BEHAVIOUR ALL THE TIMES WITH SAME CONFIGURATION
             EVEN WITH RANDOM SEED ON !!!!!!!!

1: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CONFIGURABLE ITEMS FOR THE TEST READ FROM CONFIG FILE OR PRE-DEFINED.
2: AS NACHOS ALWAYS WILL GIVE SAME PREDICTABLE RESULT ALL THE TIMES WITH SAME CONFIGURATION,
3: WRITE A SCRIPT TO SAVE CURRENT GDB SESSION TO A FILE.
4: REPEAT STEPS 1-2-3 SEVERAL TIMES. 
5: COMPARE FILES GENERATED FROM STEP 3 TO PROVE IT WORKS EXACTLY THE SAME WAY ALL THE TIMES WITH SAME CONFIGURATION.
