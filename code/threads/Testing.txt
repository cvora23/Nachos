            ASSUMPTIONS: NACHOS WILL GIVE SAME PREDICTABLE OUTPUT BEHAVIOUR ALL THE TIMES WITH SAME CONFIGURATION
                         EVEN WITH RANDOM SEED ON !!!!!!!!

1: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CONFIGURABLE ITEMS FOR THE TEST READ FROM CONFIG FILE OR PRE-DEFINED. --- (DONE)

2: MAKE SURE EACH NUMBER OF THREADS ARE PRE-DEFINED. DEFINE ALL THE THREADS MACROS 
   IN MAKEFILE (Makefile.common Line no: 29, Line no: 137).  ----- (DONE)

3: NOW WITH ALL THE CONFIGURABLE ITEMS SET RUN THE TEST WITH OPTION

   ./testScript.sh -P2 N -d p on Aludra Server. (This creates new itemConfigFile and customerConfigFile.
                                                             This is new TEST SCENARIO)
   
   ./testScript.sh -P2 -d p on Aludra Server. (Runs the same previous PREVIOUS TEST SCENARIO)
    
   Keep running the same test again and again to create TEST LOG with same TEST SCENARIO
     

4: AS NACHOS ALWAYS WILL GIVE SAME PREDICTABLE RESULT ALL THE TIMES WITH SAME CONFIGURATION,
     
5: STEP 3 would create log files in directory called /home/scf-05/ptaskar/nachos-csci402/code/threads/terminal-logs
    
6: Now on your local machine, run,
    expect ./scpDownloadScript.sh
    
7: STEP 5 creates a new directory called 
                /home/cvora/localNachosRepo/nachos-csci402/code/threads/testResultHomeDir/"CurrentDateTimeFolder"

8: USE BEYOND COMPARE TOOL TO COMPARE THE SAME TEST CONFIGURATION TO PROVE SUCCESS FOR SAME TEST SCENARIO SAME LOG FILE OUTPUT...
