::::::::::::::::::::::::::HOW DO I TEST:::::::::::::::::::::::::

            ASSUMPTIONS: NACHOS WILL GIVE SAME PREDICTABLE OUTPUT BEHAVIOUR ALL THE TIMES WITH SAME CONFIGURATION
                         EVEN WITH RANDOM SEED ON !!!!!!!!

1: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CONFIGURABLE ITEMS FOR THE TEST READ FROM CONFIG FILE OR PRE-DEFINED.

2: MAKE SURE EACH NUMBER OF THREADS ARE PRE-DEFINED. DEFINE ALL THE THREADS MACROS
   IN MAKEFILE.....

3: NOW WITH ALL THE CONFIGURABLE ITEMS SET RUN THE TEST WITH OPTION
   gdb --args ./nachos -P2 configFile.ini -d pt 

4: AS NACHOS ALWAYS WILL GIVE SAME PREDICTABLE RESULT ALL THE TIMES WITH SAME CONFIGURATION,

5: USE SCRIPT COMMAND ON UNIX TO SAVE THE CURRENT TERMINAL SESSION. TIME STAMP THE CURRENT SESSION FILE.

6: USE BEYOND COMPARE TOOL TO COMPARE THE SAME TEST CONFIGURATION TO PROVE SUCCESS...
